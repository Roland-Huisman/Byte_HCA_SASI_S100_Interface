This is the Byte HCA SASI to S100 Interface. It is designed to use with a Xebec 1410 SASI to MFM controller.
I have drawn this schematics and PCB from the article back in 2017. I have a few bare PCB's left. 
These are for people who want to participate to get it running under CP/M. There is a topic about the
controller on the VCFED forum.

Kicad files and gerbers are available as well. But this project is not finished yet.
It is all preliminary...
